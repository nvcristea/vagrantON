SugarCRM VagrantON Stacks
=========================

## Deprecated!

As the source code was integrated with [SugarCRM Engineering Stacks](https://github.com/sugarcrm/stacks), this repository will no longer be maintained. 

Use the [SugarCRM VagrantON Stacks](https://github.com/sugarcrm/stacks/tree/master/vagrant-on).

## About

SugarCRM VagrantON Stacks it's built on top and dependent by [SugarCRM Engineering Stacks](https://github.com/sugarcrm/stacks).

VagrantON provides flexibility on top of VM Stacks such as:

 * fast and easy configurable, including shared folders and forwarded ports;
 * can run and control multiples stacks on the same time (ex: `vagrant up php55`);
 * private network ip as secondary adapter;
 * integrated with PHPStorm;
 * easy to use and control each stack trough local config/_private.yml file;
 

## Install

### Easy steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/svnvcristea/vagrantON.git
cd vagrantON
bash app/setup.sh
vagrant up
```


It's very easy con configure it by changing values in the [`config/_private.yml`](config/_private.yml)

**Without your [`config/_private.yml`](config/_private.yml) in place will use the `DEFAULT_STACK:` configurations from [`config/config.yml`](config/config.yml)**

## Stacks

Supported Stacks are:
```yaml
stacks: [db2, mts, oracle, oracle12c, php54, php55, php56, phpenv, qa-php53, qa-php54, ubuntu-driver]
```
So, `vagrant up` with ACTIVE_STACK = php54 in [`config/_private.yml`](config/_private.yml) will start the 'php54' stack by default. 
In case you will send the name of the stack from cli, the ACTIVE_STACK will be overwritten with the stack sent.
This mean that `vagrant up oracle12c` will start the 'oracle12c' stack.

### 1st vON Stack

When you want to start the box, just type `vagrant up` from this directory in a terminal window.
Once the box has been provisioned, you can access it by typing in `vagrant ssh` (or `vagrant ssh php54`) from the same terminal window.  
It will log you in as the vagrant user, which has unrestricted sudo access.

### Additional vON Stack

In order to start an additional VM stack just place the stack name after vagrant up : `vagrant up php56`
or change the value of ACTIVE_STACK from your [`config/_private.yml`](config/_private.yml) and `vagrant up`

## PHPStorm integration

From PHPStorm Menu `File -> Settings -> Tools -> Vagrant` :

 * set at `Instance folder:` your folder `~/vagrantOn`
 * add at `Environment variables` a new variable:
   * `Name` : `ACTIVE_STACK` and 
   * `Value` : `php55` (or the name of the stack) 

## Update Stacks

In order to get last stacks:

```bash
bash app/setup.sh update
```
